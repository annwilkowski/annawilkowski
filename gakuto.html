    <h2 class="typewriter">Gakuto Club</h2>
    <p>
        I programmed a Yaskawa robot using a programmable logic controller to play tic-tac-toe, ensuring it could always win or tie. 
        I also collaborated with the team on planning future club initiatives and worked on programming 2D Cappex cameras to enhance 
        the robot's vision and perception capabilities.

    <h2 class="typewriter">Winter Cup</h2>
    <p>
        I taught middle school students how to use Smart Pendants for advanced programming, helping them tackle complex concepts with 
        hands-on learning. I also worked with my team on various programming challenges, which paid off when we won the Gakuto Cup. 
        On the technical side, I used Motosight 2D and Cappex cameras for tasks like color sorting, quality control, and retrieving 
        randomized objects.
